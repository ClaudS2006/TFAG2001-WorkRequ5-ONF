Restaurant Reservation Page

https://cosmic-impact-clauds2025.netlify.app/

For this task, you will create a responsive 
and dynamic Restaurant Reservation Page to 
demonstrate your skills in HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript. This project will showcase your 
understanding of inline and block-level elements,
Flexbox layouts, responsive design, 
and client-side form handling.

Learning Objectives:

Structure a webpage using valid HTML5 with 
semantic elements.
Implement a flexible layout with Flexbox and 
responsive design using media queries.
Create an accessible and interactive form 
with JavaScript for client-side functionality.

Project Idea & Overview:

Your task is to create a Restaurant 
Reservation Page . The page should have 
distinct sections that showcase a welcome 
message, a brief menu highlight 
(or featured dishes), 
and a booking form where visitors can reserve 
a table. Use this project to demonstrate your 
understanding of:

Inline vs. block-level elements

Flexbox layouts

!!! Responsive breakpoints and typography

Forms and inputs

Basic client-side form handling with JavaScript

Submission Requirements
Create:

Use CodePen to create a project.

HTML Structure & Inline vs. Block Elements:

Use a valid HTML5 structure with semantic elements
such as header , main , footer , and section .
Demonstrate an understanding of 
inline vs. block-level elements 
by using elements such as <span> or <a> (inline) 
and <div> or <section> (block-level) where 
appropriate.
Include headings ( h1 through h6 ) and 
text elements ( p , strong , em ) to format 
your welcome text, menu highlights, and 
any additional descriptions.

Flexbox Layout:

Create a flexible, responsive layout for 
your page. For example, you might place a 
horizontal navigation bar at the top, 
a multi-column featured-menu section, 
and a footer with social media links or 
restaurant details.
Use Flexbox properties 
( display: flex; , justify-content , align-items ,
flex-wrap , etc.) to organize these sections 
in a visually appealing way.

Responsive Design with Breakpoints:

Implement media queries to adjust the layout 
and typography for smaller screens 
(e.g., mobile) and larger screens (desktop).
Ensure headings, paragraphs, and images 
remain legible and well-structured at 
all screen sizes.

Forms & Inputs (Restaurant Reservation Form):

Create a form section where users can enter 
their reservation details: name, email or phone 
number, date and time of reservation, number of 
guests, and any special requests.
Use appropriate input types 
(text , email , date , time , number , etc.) 
along with label elements for accessibility.
Add basic styling for input fields and 
focus states to guide users effectively.

Form Submission with JavaScript:

Write client-side JavaScript that listens for 
the form submission event. When the form is 
submitted, you could:
Log the reservation details to the console 
(for demonstration purposes).
Display a confirmation message on the page 
indicating that the reservation request was 
received.
Include simple form validation 
(e.g., check if the email field contains a valid 
email format, ensure the date/time is not in the
past, etc.).

Testing & Validation:

Validate your HTML and CSS to ensure there are 
no errors before sumbission using online tools 
like W3C Markup Validation Service and W3C CSS 
Validation Service .
Test responsiveness by resizing your browser 
and/or using device emulators.
Confirm your form submission process works as 
expected, providing meaningful feedback to users 
upon success or input errors.

Upload and Submit:

Submit your project either as a CodePen link, 
a GitHub repository, or a ZIP file containing 
the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The teacher 
will review your use of inline vs. block elements,
Flexbox, responsive design, and JavaScript 
form submission for correctness and creativity.
