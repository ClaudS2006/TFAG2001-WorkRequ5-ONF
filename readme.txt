Restaurant Reservation Page April 2025

I created a responsive 
and dynamic Restaurant Reservation Page to 
demonstrate my skills in HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript. This project showcases my 
understanding of inline and block-level elements,
Flexbox layouts, responsive design, 
and client-side form handling.

Assement Criteria:

Structure the webpage using valid HTML5 with 
semantic elements.
Implementing a flexible layout with Flexbox and 
responsive design using media queries.
Created an accessible and interactive form 
with JavaScript for client-side functionality.

The page has distinct sections that showcase 
a welcome message, a brief menu highlight 
(featured dishes), 
and a booking form where visitors can reserve 
a table.

HTML / CSS / JS knowledge:

Responsive breakpoints and typography
Forms and inputs
Basic client-side form handling with JavaScript

////////////////////////////////////////////////

HTML Structure & Inline vs. Block Elements:

- valid HTML5 structure with semantic elements
such as header , main , footer , and section
 
- inline vs. block-level elements 
using elements such as <span> or <a> (inline) 
and <div> or <section> (block-level)

- headings ( h1 through h6 ) and 
text elements ( p , strong , em ) to format 
welcome text, menu highlights, and 
any additional descriptions

////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Flexbox Layout:

- horizontal navigation bar at the top

- a column featured-menu section, 

- a footer with social media links &  
restaurant details

- Flexbox properties 
(display: flex; , justify-content , align-items ,
flex-wrap , etc.) to organize these sections 
in a visually appealing way

///////////////////////////////////////////////////

Responsive Design with Breakpoints:

- media queries to adjust the layout 
and typography for smaller screens 
(e.g., mobile) and larger screens (desktop)

- headings, paragraphs, and images 
remain legible and well-structured at 
all screen sizes

//////////////////////////////////////////////////

Forms & Inputs (Restaurant Reservation Form):

- a form section where users can enter 
their reservation details: name, email or phone 
number, date and time of reservation, number of 
guests, and any special requests

- appropriate input types 
(text , email , date , time , number , etc.) 
along with label elements for accessibility

- basic styling for input fields and 
focus states to guide users effectively

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Form Submission with JavaScript:

- client-side JavaScript that listens for 
the form submission event (when the form is 
submitted, display of confirmation message on the page 
indicating that the reservation request was 
received

- simple form validation 
(e.g., check if the email field contains a valid 
email format, ensure the date/time is not in the
past, correct pattern etc.)
